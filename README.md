# README #

* This is a set of utilities to provide "syntactic sugar" and help with clean code. The idea of this library is to remove hard to read operators like "!", help code "read" left to right, reduce null checking and remove nested logic. If you have an idea please feel free to contribute.

### Contributing ###
* Modify the code and do a pull request
* I will do a code review and suggest any improvements
* Note: Code will be rejected if it is not Unit Tested or of a high standard.
* Please stick to SOLID principles.
* Eventually I will start documenting some standards on the Wiki page.
